Input data to our algorithm:
Over 700 records of beats. 
You can run inputScraper.py (which is in code.zip) to write to the csv input file from the given urls from twitter and the 20 unique samples.

We scraped the beats from a website called the beatmaker, in which there are 8 instruments and 32 “nodes”, in which each node can be turned on/off. Turning a node on means that there will be a sound by that specific instrument at that point in time. Hence, to store this data, for each record, we construct an array of 0s and 1s of length (32 nodes * 8 instruments). Hence, we have over 700 of such arrays.

We used twitterscraper (https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper) to get the urls for the beatmaker. We then get the input data from each of these individual urls/records.
